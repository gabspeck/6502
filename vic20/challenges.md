Here are some absolute beginner level VIC-20 assembly programming challenges, starting from the simplest and gradually increasing in complexity:

## Display and Memory Basics

1. **Hello World** - Write "HELLO" to the screen at position 0,0 using direct screen memory writes ($1E00)

2. **Fill Screen** - Fill the entire screen with a single character (like asterisks)

3. **Clear Screen** - Clear the screen by filling it with spaces

4. **Color Change** - Change the border and background colors using VIC registers

5. **Single Character Move** - Display a character that can be moved with keyboard input (WASD or cursor keys)

## Simple Graphics and Patterns

6. **Draw a Box** - Draw a rectangular border around the screen using PETSCII characters

7. **Checkerboard Pattern** - Create a checkerboard pattern on the screen

8. **Color Bars** - Create horizontal color bars using the color memory ($9600)

9. **Simple Animation** - Make a character "bounce" between two screen positions

10. **Scrolling Message** - Create a single-line message that scrolls across the screen

## Input and Interaction

11. **Key Echo** - Read keyboard input and display the pressed key on screen

12. **Counter Display** - Create a counter that increments when a key is pressed

13. **Simple Menu** - Create a menu with 3 options that can be selected with number keys

14. **Reaction Timer** - Display a character after random delay, measure response time

15. **Simon Says** - Create a simple 4-step pattern memory game

## Sound and Timing

16. **Single Beep** - Make the VIC-20 produce a simple beep sound

17. **Scale Player** - Play a musical scale using the sound registers

18. **Metronome** - Create a visual and audio metronome with adjustable speed

19. **Sound Effects** - Create 3 different sound effects (laser, explosion, pickup)

## Mini Games

20. **Guess the Number** - Computer picks 1-10, player guesses with higher/lower hints

21. **Dice Roller** - Simulate rolling 2 dice with random numbers and display

22. **Catch the Star** - A star appears randomly, player must "catch" it with cursor

23. **Snake (Single Segment)** - Control a single character that leaves a trail

24. **Pong Paddle** - Create a paddle that moves up/down and bounces a ball

## Memory and Data

25. **String Reverser** - Input a short string and display it reversed

26. **Bubble Sort** - Sort 5 numbers and display them

27. **Pattern Memorizer** - Display a pattern for 2 seconds, then ask player to recreate it

28. **High Score Keeper** - Keep track of a high score between game runs

29. **Character Designer** - Let user modify a custom character definition

30. **Mini Text Editor** - Allow typing and backspace on a single line

Each challenge focuses on fundamental concepts like:
- Memory-mapped I/O
- VIC chip registers
- PETSCII characters
- Keyboard input via KERNAL routines
- Basic loops and branching
- Simple arithmetic and logic
- Random number generation
- Timing delays

These challenges assume only 5K of RAM (unexpanded VIC-20) and use built-in KERNAL routines where appropriate. They're designed to be completed in under 100 lines of assembly code each.
